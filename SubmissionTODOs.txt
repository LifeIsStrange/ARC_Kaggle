This is a list of things to be done when creating the submission file, before submitting it.

- Delete Task., Models., Utils.
- Delete extra imports
- Comment/Uncomment getBestMoveShapes (only useful if onlyShapeColorChanges?)
- Comment/Uncomment CNN methods (getBestSameNSampleColorsCNN seems to solve one, the others not)
- Specify "submission=True" when initializing Task.Task objects
