- CropShape:
First identify if output is in the input
Then find identifying characteristic. 
cropshape tasks:
[13,35,56,78,87,110,120,133,173,176,194,215,216,217,262,270,289,299,318,345,264,383,395]


- outshape is in input 
	input:
	- unique [56]
	- more replicas [78]
	- unique color strict/nonstrict [13,35,78,87]
	- unique shape
	- symmetric 
	- largest [35,87]
	- smallest

	output:
	- only shape strict/nonstrict [13,35,78,87,110,215,217,262,270]
	- diff color [,]
	- diff size [
	- replicate [56,78,194,216]
solved: 13, 262


- color nonstric shape

PROBLEM: identifying a shape
	- store as attributes? shape "needs to know about whole matrix". initiate shape with attribute list? 
	- need a function: def shape_attributes(refshape, matrix)
	- 		   def crop_shape(matrix, attributes)
cropframe: 
[90,]
